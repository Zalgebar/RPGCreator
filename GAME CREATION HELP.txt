System.out.println("GAME CREATION HELP\n
\n
The games rely on text input. In order to create a successful game, its \n
important to plan ahead and create a game-plan.\n
It's up to you how specific or helpful you want your game to be.\n
\n
Each game contains STAGES and there can be as many as you like.\n
Each STAGE contains INPUTS; each INPUT elicits a RESPONSE from the console.\n
For example, if the INPUT you want is "look around", and the RESPONSE is "You \n
see you are in a large room.", gameplay could look like this:\n
\n
 > look around\n
 You see you are in a large room.\n
\n
 > _\n
\n
Each STAGE can have as many inputs (and their associated responses) as you'd \n
like.\n
\n
Every STAGE also requires a:
PROMPT which tells the player to enter a command.\n
       (Will be displayed before every user input field.)\n
DEFAULT which tells the player that the input they entered does not have an\n      associated response.\n
HELP which is meant to help the player interact with and use the program.\n
     (Will be displayed when the user enters 'help'.)\n
HINT which is meant to offer advice about the in-game content. (Will be\n         displayed when the user enters 'hint'.)\n
QUIT which displays when the user chooses to quit (enters 'quit').\n
\n
Once created, the game will ask for a filename to save under.\n
The default path is the local path (where the program is located.) and\n
the automatic file extension is '.dat'.\n
After that, you can share the program and the game you created with anyone!");
